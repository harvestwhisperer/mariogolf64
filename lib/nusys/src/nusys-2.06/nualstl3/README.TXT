About NuSystem for Sound Tools Ver3.0	


[1]  Installation
First, confirm that the libraries and headers in the lib directory of MUS Library 
Ver. 3 have been copied to the desired location. 

Then, move to the nualstl3 directory and enter the following command to install the 
NuSystem library.  

  make -f makefile.dos install

This will install the NuSystem for libmus 3.0 in the location specified by N64KITDIR 
in makefile.dos (default is c:\nintendo\n64kit). 

[2]  How to Compile 
When reconstructing the nualstl3 library, please use the following procedure. 

Normally, since the NuSystem source is installed at 

  X:\nintendo\n64kit\nusys\src

(X: is the drive on which NuSystem has been installed.)

as the compressed file nusys-120.lzh, decompress the file at that location copy 
nualstl3 to a directory under the "nusys-1.20" directory created by the 
decompression. 

This can then be compiled by entering 

  >make -f makfile.dos

(Note) 
Libraries associated with N64 Sound Tools (libgmus.a, libn_gaudio_sc.a, etc.) are 
compatible with OS 2.01 Patch 5 and later.  When OS 2.01 Patch 4 or an earlier 
version  running, the libraries must be reconstructed.  Remove the comments from 
the following line in the respective source files and compile. 

    OLD_AUDIO_DEF = -D_OLD_AUDIO_LIBRARY


[3]  Changes to NuSystem

Most of the functions libmus 3.0 and their operation have been changed from the 
previous version. However, the differences have been absorbed on the NuSystem side 
as much as possible. Also, libraries for the audio microcode and the n_audio 
microcode can now be generated from the same source. 


Overview of Changes

An mus library for NuSystem used to be required, but the scheduler can now be 
changed from libmus 3.0.  Therefore,  the program has been changed so that libmus 
can be used as it is.  However, until now, the mus library was changed so that the 
areas for the sound effects bank and/or binary songs, etc. were reserved from the 
audio heap area.  This can not be done when libmus is used unaltered.  The 
__MusInitMemMalloc() function of the libmus internal functions is used to resolve 
this. 

Since sound effects from libmus 3.0 are now handled as effect bank files and their 
functions have also been changed, changes were made on the NuSystem side. 

The functions which have been changed and the newly added functions are listed 
below. 


Changed Functions 

nuAuStlinit()
The members of the argument musConfig, which until now were virtually unused, are 
now all used.  Therefore, please set all members to their default settings.  
However, the default value (auConfig) is used when NULL is specified. 

nuAuStlMgrInit()
The existing initialization for DMA call back and initialization of the sequencer 
have been deleted so that registration of the scheduler and initialization of mus 
is performed. In addition, the argument has been changed to a pointer for the 
musConfig structure. 


Added Functions 

nuAuStlSeqPlayerInit()
This has been added due to changes in the handling of sequences and sound effects. 
This maintains a sequence (binary song) area from the audio heap area.  
Consequently, use size to specify the maximum number of sequence files to be used 
in the game. 

nuAuStlSndPlayerInit()
This has been added because sound effects have been stored in separate files. 
This maintains a sound effect (binary song effects bank) area from the audio heap 
area.  Consequently, use size to specify the maximum number of sound effect files 
to be used in the game. 



Deleted Functions 

nuAuStlPlayerInit()
nuAuStlPlayerInit() has been changed to nuAuStlSeqPlayerInit(). 
In addition, MusInitialize() used to be called by this function, but now it is 
called by nuAuStlMgrInit().  nuAuStlPlayerInit() is defined as nuAuStlSeqPlaerInit() 
using a macro. 

Other 
Volume, pan, and tempo specifications are defined by macros, but functions which do 
not exist in libmus 3.0 cannot be used.  In addition, please note that none have 
been newly created.
